## What is Whispering?

Press a shortcut anywhere on your desktop → speak → get text in your clipboard. That's it.

**Try it in 2 minutes:** [Quick Start](#quick-start) | [Watch Demo (30s)](#demo)

Whispering is the transcription app I built because I believe productivity tools should be free and accessible to everyone.

Whispering is free and open source—you own your data, you audit the code, and you control your privacy.

Bring your own API key from providers like `OpenAI`, `Groq`, or `ElevenLabs`, and pay only cents per hour instead of monthly subscriptions. Or use a local transcription service like `Speaches`, which keeps everything free and on-device. Your audio goes directly to your chosen service.

Open source. No tracking. No paywalls.

> **Note**: Whispering is designed for quick transcriptions, not long recordings. For extended recording sessions, use a dedicated recording app.

## Demo

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eca93701-10a0-4d91-b38a-f715bd7e0357

## Why I Built This

I was tired of the usual SaaS problems:

- **The pricing was nuts.** Most transcription services charge $15-30/month for what should cost at most $2. You're paying for their profit margin.
- **You have no idea what happens to your recordings.** Your recordings get uploaded to someone else's servers, processed by their systems, and stored according to their privacy policy.
- **Limited options.** Most services use OpenAI's Whisper behind the scenes anyway, but you can't switch providers, can't use faster models, and can't go local when you need privacy.
- **Things just disappear.** Companies pivot, get acquired, or shut down. Then you're stuck migrating your workflows and retraining your muscle memory.

So I built Whispering the way transcription should work:

- **No middleman** - Your audio goes straight to the provider you choose (or stays fully local)
- **Your keys, your costs** - Pay OpenAI/Groq/whoever directly at actual rates: $0.02-$0.18/hour instead of $20/month
- **Actually yours** - Open source means no one can take it away, change the pricing, or sunset the service

### Cost Comparison

With Whispering, you pay providers directly instead of marked-up subscription prices:

| Service | Cost per Hour | Light Use (20 min/day) | Moderate Use (1 hr/day) | Heavy Use (3 hr/day) | Traditional Tools |
|---------|---------------|------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| `distil-whisper-large-v3-en` (Groq) | $0.02 | $0.20/month | $0.60/month | $1.80/month | $15-30/month |
| `whisper-large-v3-turbo` (Groq) | $0.04 | $0.40/month | $1.20/month | $3.60/month | $15-30/month |
| `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe` (OpenAI) | $0.18 | $1.80/month | $5.40/month | $16.20/month | $15-30/month |
| Local (Speaches) | $0.00 | $0.00/month | $0.00/month | $0.00/month | $15-30/month |

### Common Issues

- **No transcription?** → Double-check API key in Settings
- **Shortcut not working?** → Bring Whispering to foreground (see macOS section below)
- **Wrong provider selected?** → Check Settings → Transcription

<details>
<summary><strong>macOS: Global shortcut stops working?</strong></summary>

This happens due to macOS App Nap, which suspends background apps to save battery.

**Quick fixes:**
1. Bring Whispering to the foreground briefly to restore shortcuts
2. Keep the app window in the foreground (even as a smaller window)
3. Use Voice Activated mode for hands-free operation

**Best practice:** Keep Whispering in the foreground in front of other apps. You can resize it to a smaller window or use Voice Activated mode for minimal disruption.

## How is my data stored?

Whispering stores as much data as possible locally on your device, including recordings and text transcriptions. This approach ensures maximum privacy and data security. Here's an overview of how data is handled:

1. **Local Storage**: Voice recordings and transcriptions are stored in IndexedDB, which is used as blob storage and a place to store all of your data like text and transcriptions.

2. **Transcription Service**: The only data sent elsewhere is your recording to an external transcription service—if you choose one. You have the following options:
   - External services like OpenAI, Groq, or ElevenLabs (with your own API keys)
   - A local transcription service such as Speaches, which keeps everything on-device

3. **Transformation Service (Optional)**: Whispering includes configurable transformation settings that allow you to pipe transcription output into custom transformation flows. These flows can leverage:
   - External Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini, or Groq's Llama models
   - Hosted LLMs within your custom workflows for advanced text processing
   - Simple find-and-replace operations for basic text modifications
   
   When using AI-powered transformations, your transcribed text is sent to your chosen LLM provider using your own API key. All transformation configurations, including prompts and step sequences, are stored locally in your settings.

You can change both the transcription and transformation services in the settings to ensure maximum local functionality and privacy.

#### Architecture Patterns
- Service Layer: Platform-agnostic business logic with Result types
- Query Layer: Reactive data management with caching
- RPC Pattern: Unified API interface (`rpc.recordings.getAllRecordings`)
- Dependency Injection: Clean separation of concerns

### Architecture Deep Dive

Whispering uses a clean three-layer architecture that separates concerns and makes the codebase easy to understand and extend:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
│  UI Layer   │ --> │  Query Layer│ --> │ Service Layer│
│ (Svelte 5)  │     │ (TanStack)  │     │   (Pure)     │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └──────────────┘
      ↑                    │
      └────────────────────┘
         Reactive Updates
```

#### Service Layer - Pure Business Logic

The service layer is where all business logic lives—pure functions that handle everything from audio transcription to clipboard operations. What makes it special is its complete isolation from UI concerns: services don't know about Svelte stores, user settings, or reactive state. Instead, they accept explicit parameters and return consistent `Result<T, E>` types for robust error handling.

Services transparently handle platform differences between desktop (Tauri) and web environments. When you import a service like `clipboard`, it automatically selects the right implementation at build time. This design keeps business logic testable, reusable, and platform-agnostic. [→ Learn more in the Services README](./apps/app/src/lib/services/README.md)

#### Query Layer - The RPC Pattern

The query layer acts as a reactive bridge between UI components and the service layer, implementing what we call the **RPC pattern**. Think of `rpc` as your app's unified API—every operation is available through a single import:

```typescript
import { rpc } from '$lib/query';

// Reactive usage in components
const recordings = createQuery(rpc.recordings.getAllRecordings.options);

// Imperative usage in actions
const { data, error } = await rpc.transcription.transcribe.execute(blob);
```

This dual interface design provides both reactive state management for UI components and direct execution for workflows. Under the hood, it wraps service functions with TanStack Query for caching, optimistic updates, and error handling. [→ Deep dive into the Query Layer README](./apps/app/src/lib/query/README.md)

#### Error Handling with WellCrafted

Whispering uses [WellCrafted](https://github.com/wellcrafted-dev/wellcrafted), a lightweight TypeScript library I created to bring Rust-inspired error handling to JavaScript. I built WellCrafted specifically to solve the error handling challenges in Whispering, and now use it throughout the codebase. Unlike traditional try-catch blocks that hide errors, WellCrafted makes all potential failures explicit in function signatures using the `Result<T, E>` pattern.

**Key benefits in Whispering:**
- **Explicit errors**: Every function that can fail returns `Result<T, E>`, making errors impossible to ignore
- **Type safety**: TypeScript knows exactly what errors each function can produce
- **Serialization-safe**: Errors are plain objects that survive JSON serialization (critical for Tauri IPC)
- **Rich context**: Structured `TaggedError` objects include error names, messages, context, and causes
- **Zero overhead**: ~50 lines of code, < 2KB minified, no dependencies

This approach ensures robust error handling across the entire codebase, from service layer functions to UI components, while maintaining excellent developer experience with TypeScript's control flow analysis.

### Run Whispering in Local Development Mode

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/braden-w/whispering.git`
2. Change into the project directory: `cd whispering`
3. Install the necessary dependencies: `pnpm i`

To run the desktop app and website:
```bash
cd apps/app
pnpm tauri dev
```


### Build The Executable Yourself

If you have concerns about the installers or want more control, you can build the executable yourself. This requires more setup, but it ensures that you are running the code you expect. Such is the beauty of open-source software!

#### Desktop

```bash
cd apps/app
pnpm i
pnpm tauri build
```

Find the executable in `apps/app/target/release`
